# Multigraph Layout Algorithm
Python script implementing a sequential layout algorithm for schematics modeled as a multigraph (for university course: ‘Engineering Software Packages for Computer Systems Design’)

## Script execution:

```bash
python3 ekz1.py
```

Then, enter the size of the square matrix in the terminal, or the name of the file "matrix.txt" where the matrix will be located. Where "*" stands for spaces. After that, enter the limit m—the maximum number of external links allowed for the chunk.
